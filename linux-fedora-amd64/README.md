# Ideas Studio - Fedora amd64 development package

Built from the shared implementation with a Linux x64 runtime guard. **Not runtime-tested on Fedora.** Do not treat a successful build as Linux qualification.

For an explicit development trial, add this folder through OpenChamber **Settings > Extensions** on a local Linux x64 host. The package uses OpenChamber's runtime, not a separately installed Node/Python or backend. Protected, remote, and relay connections are not supported.

It offers Summary, Word, Slides, Spreadsheet, Web page, PDF, Mind map, Flashcards, Quiz, and Infographic from selected project documents (text, Word, PDF, PowerPoint, Excel, old Office formats and more) and the current chat, totalling at most 200,000 characters. Generation uses OpenCode's base model configuration; export creates a new file and refuses to overwrite existing files. History is under `.studio/`.

Source and full specification: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MintageOfMan/ideas-studio-for-openchamber). Platform qualification, including PDF font loading on Linux, and the Podcast and Picture formats remain pending.
